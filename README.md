# **Hospital Administration Analysis – Excel Project**

## **Overview**

This project explores hospital administration data to understand the factors that influence patient readmissions and overall clinical performance. Using Excel as the primary analysis tool, the project examines patterns across demographics, diagnoses, utilization history, medication indicators and clinical outcomes.
The purpose of the analysis is to transform raw hospital data into meaningful insights that can support better decision-making, improve patient care and help administrators identify opportunities to reduce avoidable readmissions.

## **Files in This Repository**

**HA_Data.xlsx**
Raw dataset containing patient encounter details, diagnoses, utilization history, medication flags, demographic attributes and readmission outcomes.

**HA_Basic_Level_Analysis.xlsx**
Foundational analysis covering:
• Age-wise readmission patterns
• Length of stay differences across specialties
• Impact of prior emergency visits
• Diabetes status and readmission risk
• Effects of changes in medication

**HA_Medium_Level_Analysis.xlsx**
Intermediate analysis exploring:
• Readmission trends over time (synthetic date field)
• Influence of comorbidities
• Role of discharge dispositions
• Demographic differences in lab procedures and medications
• Diagnosis-wise utilization patterns
• Interactions between weight and diagnosis

**HA_Advanced_Level_Analysis.xlsx**
Advanced analytical work covering:
• Predictive readmission risk factors
• Patient segmentation based on utilization behavior
• Financial implications of avoidable readmissions
• Social determinants influencing outcomes
• Framework for a follow-up program to reduce readmission rates

**Case Study Document**
Full project brief including the problem statement, data dictionary and complete set of questions.

**Solution Guide**
A structured explanation of answers across the Basic, Medium and Advanced levels, written in a clear and human-focused manner.

## **Key Insights from the Analysis**

The analysis highlights several meaningful patterns:

• Readmission risk increases with age and the number of diagnosed conditions.
• Certain specialties handle more complex cases and show longer inpatient stays.
• Patients with frequent emergency visits tend to return more often, signaling instability or limited outpatient support.
• Diabetic patients and those undergoing medication adjustments show heightened readmission vulnerability.
• Discharge planning and patient satisfaction have measurable influence on recovery quality.
• Social and demographic factors contribute to differences in readmission outcomes.

## **Tools and Methods Used**

The project uses Microsoft Excel for all analysis, modeling and visualization. Key techniques include pivot tables, correlation analysis, trend interpretation, segmentation logic and structured comparison of clinical variables.

## **Purpose of This Project**

This project demonstrates practical healthcare analytics using Excel. It reflects a step-by-step approach to understanding patient outcomes, identifying operational challenges and presenting insights in a way that supports informed decision-making in a hospital setting.

If you want an even more polished version with your **name, screenshots, badges or links**, I can create that as well.
